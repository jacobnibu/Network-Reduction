# Network-Reduction
<p>This is a codebase associated with an Information Visualization project where large directed and undirected networks having thousands of nodes and edges had to be pruned to a few hundred nodes and their associated edges.</p>
<p>The particular network being pruned is a research paper citation network created out of citation data downloaded from Thomson ISI's Web of Science database. The pruning is done based on presence of certain keywords as well as network parameters like authority score, PageRank, etc.</p>
